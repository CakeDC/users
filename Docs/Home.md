The **Users** plugin is for allowing users to register and login manage their profile. It also allows admins to manage the users.

The plugin is thought as a base to extend your app specific users controller and model from.

That it works out of the box doesn't mean it is thought to be used exactly like it is but to provide you a kick start. You will have to extend the plugin on app level to customize it. Read the instructions carefully.

Translations
============

The Plugin is translated into several languages:

* Swedish (sv) by @digitalfotografen
* Spanish (es) by @florenciohernandez
* Brazillian Portuguese (pt_BR) by @andtxr
* French (fr_FR) by @jtraulle
* Polish (pl) by @joulbex

**Note:** To overwrite the plugin translations, create a file inside your project 'src/Locale/{$lang}/' folder, with the name 'Users.po' and add the strings with the new translations.

Remember to clean the translations cache!

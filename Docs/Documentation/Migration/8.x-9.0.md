Migration 8.x to 9.0
======================

9.0 uses the new plugins cakephp/authentication[(read more)](../Authentication.md) and cakephp/authorization[(read more)](../Authorization.md)  instead of CakePHP
Authentication component. This version is compatible with CakePHP ^3.6 and the plugin
code was updated to remove all deprecations. 

Configuration file users.php
----------------------------
We have added/removed/changed some configurations to work with new authentication/authorization
plugins, if you created a custom config file, please compare your file with the default
config/users.php from this plugin.

* Users.middlewareQueueLoader was added;

* Users.auth was removed since AuthComponent is not used;

* Users.Social.authenticator was removed in favor of Authenticators.CakeDC/Users.Social and
Identifiers.CakeDC/Users.Social;

* Users.GoogleAuthenticator was renamed to OneTimePasswordAuthenticator;

* Auth.authenticate was removed in favor of Auth.Authentication, Auth.AuthenticationComponent,
Auth.Authenticators, Auth.Identifiers

* Auth.authorize was removed in favor of Auth.Authorization, Auth.AuthorizationMiddleware,
Auth.AuthorizationComponent

* Added Auth.SocialLoginFailure to handle social login

* Added Auth.FormLoginFailure to handle form login

* CakeDC/Auth was upgraded and now has a better way to handle social login. 
Oauth providers config like OAuth.providers.facebook requires two new config keys, 'service' and 'mapper'.

Loading the Plugin
------------------
In this version you need to load the plugin in your [Application class](https://github.com/cakephp/app/blob/master/src/Application.php).
```
    /**
     * {@inheritDoc}
     */
    public function bootstrap()
    {
        // Call parent to load bootstrap from files.
        parent::bootstrap();
        
        //your code
       
        $this->addPlugin(\CakeDC\Users\Plugin::class);
    }
```

Renamed Events
--------------
All events constants were moved from AuthComponent to Plugin class and
their values was also updated.

* `Users.Component.UsersAuth.afterLogin` renamed to `Users.Authentication.afterLogin`
* `Users.Component.UsersAuth.beforeLogout` renamed to `Users.Authentication.beforeLogout`
